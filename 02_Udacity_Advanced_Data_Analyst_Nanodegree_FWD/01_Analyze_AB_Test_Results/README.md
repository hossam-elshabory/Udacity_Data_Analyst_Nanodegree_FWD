# Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

# Prerequisites
The used datasets can be found in the local Data folder [here](Data/)
### Languages and libraries used
- Python 3.9
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- random

# Conclusion  
We reject the null hypothesis as there is no enough evidence to accept it, or in another words there is no enough evidence that the new page is leading to more conversions.
